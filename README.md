## Analytics & Monitoring
* [Helicone](https://helicone.ai): The easiest way to capture data from your LLMs (Open Source).
* [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com): Open-source analytics for LLM applications.

## Data & Integrations
* [Trex](https://github.com/automorphic-ai/trex): Intelligently transform unstructured data to structured JSON, SQL, or other context-free grammar output.
* [SID.ai](https://www.sid.ai): Makes it easy for developers to connect LLM apps to their customers' data. ([Demo](https://demo.sid.ai/) / [Docs](https://docs.sid.ai/))
* [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com): Open-source, developer-friendly vector database for multi-modal AI. Reduce unstructure storage costs by 80% and get 1000x faster performance than parquet for AI. ([Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SweXJhboTA) / [Docs](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/))
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): Supabase Vector is the open source Vector Toolkit for Postgres. Use the Supabase client libraries to store, index, and query your vector embeddings at scale.([Demo](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/quickstarts/hello-world) / [Docs](https://supabase.com/vector))
* [Sweep AI](https://sweep.dev/): AI-powered junior dev that turns bug reports & feature requests into code changes. Developers report bugs like "the payment link on my landing page is broken" and Sweep writes the code to fix it. ([Demo](https://youtu.be/2cB6nSpNuoo) / [Docs](https://docs.sweep.dev/))
* [Outerbase](https://outerbase.com/): Outerbase is the interface for your database.

## Dataset Generation & Handling
* [Hamilton](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/): Open source micro-orchestration framework for describing dataflows. I.e. you can use it instead of LangChain. Companies like IBM, Adobe and Stitch Fix use Hamilton to model data & feature engineering pipelines, machine learning pipelines, through to prompt engineering and LLM application workflows. Runs anywhere python runs. See [examples folder](https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples).
* [FiddleCube](https://fiddlecube.ai): Generate high-quality datasets for fine-tuning LLMs in minutes.

## End-to-End Frameworks
* [Branch AI](https://www.branch-ai.com/): End-to-end tests using LLMs that simulate manual testing.
* [EdgeChains](https://github.com/arakoodev/edgechains): Open-source SDK that models generative AI applications as config management. Built on top of Jsonnet as the orchestration grammar.
* [Axilla](https://axilla.io/): Open-source AI framework for TypeScript that covers the whole lifecycle: document ingestion & retrieval, continuous evaluation, serving, monitoring. ([Docs](https://github.com/axilla-io/ax))
* [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/): AI models for speech recognition, automatic transcription, speech summarization, and more through our secure and scalable API. ([Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG_VVYtZTpU) / [Docs](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs))

## Front-End & UI Design
* [Frizz](https://www.usefriz.com/): Co-Pilot for your Social Media.
* [Tempo Labs](https://www.tempolabs.ai/): AI design & prototyping tool which generates and edits react code directly in your codebase.

## Infrastructure & Security
* [Anarchy](https://anarchy.ai): LLM infrastructure for developers. You use Anarchy to run open-source models efficiently and augmented with capabilities.
* [Aegis](https://github.com/automorphic-ai/aegis): Self-hardening firewall for large language models.
* [Pump](https://www.pump.co/): The fastest way to save 60% on AWS for free. Pump uses AI & group buying to automate cost saving with no engineering effort.
* [pyq AI](https://www.pyqai.com/): Pyq makes it easy for developers to train and deploy task-specific AI models in either their cloud or ours. We do this by providing easy-to-use software that takes in their datasets and task as inputs, and outputs a custom AI model.

## Model Performance & Evaluation
* [PromptTools](https://hegel-ai.com): Open source tools for evaluation and experimentation with prompts, models, and vector databases.
* [Parea](https://www.parea.ai): Debug, evaluate and monitor the performance of your LLM apps through testing and version control.
* [Queryvary](https://queryvary.com): Test suite for LLMs.
* [UpTrain](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain): Open-source toolkit to evaluate and monitor LLM applications on aspects like hallucinations, bias, tonality, correctness, etc.
