## Analytics & Monitoring
* [Helicone](https://helicone.ai): The easiest way to capture data from your LLMs (Open Source).
* [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com): Open-source analytics for LLM applications.

## Data Management & Integration
* [Hamilton](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/): Open source micro-orchestration framework for describing dataflows. I.e. you can use it instead of LangChain. Companies like IBM, Adobe and Stitch Fix use Hamilton to model data & feature engineering pipelines, machine learning pipelines, through to prompt engineering and LLM application workflows. Runs anywhere python runs. See [examples folder](https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/tree/main/examples).
* [Trex](https://github.com/automorphic-ai/trex): Intelligently transform unstructured data to structured JSON, SQL, or other context-free grammar output.
* [FiddleCube](https://fiddlecube.ai): Generate high-quality datasets for fine-tuning LLMs in minutes.
* [Frizz](https://www.usefriz.com/): Co-Pilot for your Social Media.
* [SID.ai](https://www.sid.ai): Makes it easy for developers to connect LLM apps to their customers' data. ([Demo](https://demo.sid.ai/) / [Docs](https://docs.sid.ai/))
* [EdgeChains](https://github.com/arakoodev/edgechains): Open Source SDK that models generative AI applications as config management. Built on top of Jsonnet as the orchestration grammar.
* [Branch AI](https://www.branch-ai.com/): End-to-end tests using LLMs that simulate manual testing.

## Front-End & UI Design
* [Tempo Labs](https://www.tempolabs.ai/): AI design & prototyping tool which generates and edits react code directly in your codebase.

## Infrastructure & Security
* [Anarchy](https://anarchy.ai): LLM infrastructure for developers. You use Anarchy to run open-source models efficiently and augmented with capabilities.
* [Aegis](https://github.com/automorphic-ai/aegis): Self-hardening firewall for large language models.
* [Pump](https://www.pump.co/): The fastest way to save 60% on AWS for free. Pump uses AI & group buying to automate cost saving with no engineering effort.


## Model Performance & Evaluation
* [Parea](https://www.parea.ai): Debug, evaluate and monitor the performance of your LLM apps through testing and version control.
* [PromptTools](https://hegel-ai.com): Open source tools for evaluation and experimentation with prompts, models, and vector databases.
* [Queryvary](https://queryvary.com): Test suite for LLMs.
* [UpTrain](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain): Open-source toolkit to evaluate and monitor LLM applications on aspects like hallucinations, bias, tonality, correctness, etc.
